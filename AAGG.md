# The Gender Gap in the Academy Awards

For this third assignment, I want to focus on the lack of gender equality on the nominees of the Academy Awards major cathegories.

As pointed out in this [article](https://www.glamour.com/story/this-chart-breaks-down-the-lack-of-female-nominees-at-the-oscars-in-key-categories-since-1928), there has been a lack of female nominees in the major categories of the Oscars since they started in 1928. After the #MeToo movements, we started to see a change, but if the topic stops being notice we will go back to the lack of representation.


### Critique

The article had a data-vis that was trying to bring focus into the difference of nominees in each of the years.
However, I believe the data visualization for this information could be represented in a better way. In the article, it's not easy to understand that each pink square in the column is represented by a year and that the grey information is not blanc, but the men's category. It takes the audience a bit of time to understand what is the graph trying to show and how to read it.

### Wireframe a solution

After finding which were the areas I thought I could improve, I started doing some wireframe that tackled the problems

### Test the solution

To test which was the best approach for the redesign of the data visualization, I share my wireframe with a couple of people. Some of their notes were the following:
1. I think I might like option B best. I think option C can be tough with so many circles whereas option A the squares are all connected into one rectangle, which looks more cohesive.
2. I think Option B is really creative in having an image in the center to show what it means. I Suppose the one concern is what if they don't understand what it means? Then again, if a person doesn't know what a DP/cinematographer does, the title name isn't going to help much.
3. My first takeaway for every option is that you are comparing men and women in different cathegories. I'm not sure which categories it represents but the different form one-another is clear.

### Build your solution

To build the solution, I ran into some trouble with the software and my data. I did two visualizations, one where you just compare the years where there were no woman nominees in each of the cathegories. Which deletes the proportion of the number of nominees per year, but makes it clear how unbalanced the main categories are:

This graph was done in Tableau. I don't know how to publish from tableau so I'm adding a screenshot of my screen.

For the second option, I try to recreate my option B wireframe. However, there were two things I didn't contemplate, I didn't have a column with percentages (So it looks like there is individual information in each of the donut pies instead of two categories male/female), and 2, I couldn't add an image to the center of the donut pie.
