# Final Project: **Part 1**

## Project Outline:

### The rise of streaming services

#### Introduction:
 
 - **The beggining of steaming services and their moderate success:**
      
      Explain how streaming services started and introduce some of the main reasons for their inital growth
      
 - **The increasing amount of content:**
      
      Bring focus in how the mix of their original content with access to classic movies and tv shows became a key reason for their progress
        
#### Point 1: **Succes for streaming plataforms**
    
 - **Exponential success & Covid-19**
        
   Original content in every platform and a new approach to TV shows. How the pandemic accelerated their growth in the last year.
        
 - **Quality entertainment for the users**
        
   Content generated primarely for stremaing services has higger scores than network and cable tv. The streaming services develop shows specificly for their users.
        
#### Point 2: **The other side of the coin**
    
  - **Overpopulation of streaming services**

    Big companies and important networks are now moving to streaming services. This implies fees, multiple accounts and way more targeted adds.
    
 - **Data adquisition**

    Streaming services have a bigger access to your individual data and it links directly with the adds or fees they charge.
        
#### Closing: **What can we do?**
    
   Using this in our favor. Being selective with the content we consume.
   Support shows and networks that aline to our views and create quality content.

## Final Project Deliverable:

For this project, I'm planning to use the suggested method in class **Shorthand**. By using an interactive website, people can have proper access to the information and the data visualizations. This will also allow to keep digging about the topic and consult extra sources.
