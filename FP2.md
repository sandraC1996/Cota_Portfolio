# Final Project: Part II

## Class Feedback:

After sharing with the class the first draft outline these are some of the comments I received and decided I should look into:
 - Provide some background about the average household spending on streaming services vs cable
 - Address since the beginning how the goal of the presentation is to make the user understand they have a say in what content is been created based on the shows they watch.
 - Which streaming service they can choose base on what you support. Ex. Which streaming services have more diverse and inclusive content creators.

This feedback helped me understand that I wasn't bringing attention to the main goal of my presentation at the beginning. I wasn't showing why it matters to the audience and which impact they could have. 

To address these concerns, I reworked the outline and change my approach to the project. I will have a quick introduction about streaming services, and I will dive right into their overpopulation and impact on households. Then I will address how these services are changing to create original content and how data has a huge role in their development.  

## Revised Outline:

### There is a way you can decide which tv show gets made next
  
Streaming services provide unique and specialize content for their viewers. They also recopile the most information about you for their benefit, but there is a way you can use this for your benefit.

#### Introduction:

  - **Netflix and the growth of streaming services:**

     Bring focus on how the mix of their original content with access to classic movies and tv shows became a key reason for their success.

#### Point 1: The overpopulation and growth of streaming services and their household impact.**

 - **Overpopulation and growth of streaming services**

   Big companies and important networks are now moving to stream services. Increase of subscribers. This implies fees, multiple accounts, and way more targeted ads.

 - **Streaming Services vs Cable TV**

   The cost and subscriptions for streaming services compared to Cable tv. Streaming services have bigger access to your individual data and it links directly with the ads or   fees they charge. 

#### Point 2: Original Content and Data acquisition**

  - **Migration from licence content to original content**
  
    Original quality content in every platform and a new approach to TV shows. The streaming services develop shows specifically for their users.

  - **Data and their impact in the creation of content**
 
    Which data is aquired and used for the development and approval of new shows.

#### Closing: How can we use this in our favor?
   Using this in our favor. Being selective with the content we consume. Support shows and networks that aline to our views and create quality content.
   
## Draft of the story:

To analyze how my story is being understend by the public, insted of doing handraw wireframes I decided to create a draft in Shorthand. Here is the link to the [story](https://preview.shorthand.com/NGa58NJK5iNJaKkk).
