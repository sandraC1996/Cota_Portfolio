# Final Project: Part II

## Class Feedback:

After sharing with the class the first draft outline these are some of the comments I received and decided I should look into:
 - Provide some background about the average household spending on streaming services vs cable
 - Address since the beginning how the goal of the presentation is to make the user understand they have a say in what content is been created based on the shows they watch.
 - Which streaming service they can choose base on what you support. Ex. Which streaming services have more diverse and inclusive content creators.

This feedback helped me understand that I wasn't bringing attention to the main goal of my presentation at the beginning. I wasn't showing why it matters to the audience and which impact they could have. 

To address these concerns, I reworked the outline and change my approach to the project. I will have a quick introduction about streaming services, and I will dive right into their overpopulation and impact on households. Then I will address how these services are changing to create original content and how data has a huge role in their development.  

## Revised Outline:

### There is a way you can decide which tv show gets made next
  
Streaming services provide unique and specialize content for their viewers. They also recopile the most information about you for their benefit, but there is a way you can use this for your benefit.

#### Introduction:

  - **Netflix and the growth of streaming services:**

     Bring focus on how the mix of their original content with access to classic movies and tv shows became a key reason for their success.

#### Point 1: The overpopulation and growth of streaming services and their household impact

 - **Overpopulation and growth of streaming services**

   Big companies and important networks are now moving to stream services. Increase of subscribers. This implies fees, multiple accounts, and way more targeted ads.

 - **Streaming Services vs Cable TV**

   The cost and subscriptions for streaming services compared to Cable tv. Streaming services have bigger access to your individual data and it links directly with the ads or   fees they charge. 

#### Point 2: Original Content and Data acquisition

  - **Migration from license content to original content**
  
    Original quality content in every platform and a new approach to TV shows. The streaming services develop shows specifically for their users.

  - **Data and their impact on the creation of content**
 
    Which data is acquired and used for the development and approval of new shows.

#### Closing: How can we use this in our favor?
   Using this in our favor. Being selective with the content we consume. Support shows and networks that aline to our views and create quality content.
   
## Draft of the story:

To analyze how my story is being understend by the public, insted of doing handraw wireframes I decided to create a draft in Shorthand. 

Here is the link to the [**story**](https://preview.shorthand.com/NGa58NJK5iNJaKkk).

## User Research and Interviews

  ### For this research interview I wanted to focus on users of multiple streaming platforms.

   The importance of this information will be more impactful to individuals that are exposed to multiple streaming services. 
    
  ### To select the target audience I focused on consumers that will directly connect to my call to action.
 
   By selecting this audience, I know they can analyze how their behavior when using streaming platforms is currently being reflected in the content. I selected 5 individuals to gather the feedback.
    
  ### To get the feedback I was looking for, these are the questions I ask the users:
   - Do you understand what each graph is trying to express?
      
   - Does the story has a good flow?
      
   - Did you feel engaged with the story?
      
   - Do the use of data and visualization support the presentation?
     
   - Is there anything extra information you wanted to learn about?
      
   - Any extra comments?  
   
   ### The feedback gather from the interviews:
   #### - **Story flow**
   
   Overall, they all agree there was a good flow through the story.
       They were some comments about: 
       - Having a bit more connection in the introduction to the final call to action.
       - There is more focus on Netflix than the other platforms, should the call to action refer to it?
       - Some information is shown in paragraphs and others in bullet points, to help the viewer you could use parallel structure
       - Most of it is really good, I'm just getting lost on how the last points connect together
       
   From these comments, I will address the introduction, the parallel structure, and the transition between points. Currently, I focused on having the outline in shorthand, and I didn't fill all the information in the text. By adding the missing information, I will hopefully create better transitions and connections between the content and the graphs. 
    
   #### - **Engagement with the story**
    
  All my interviewers agree that it was a topic they were all interested in. Comments include that it helped them raise awareness of their impact as viewers and that it was a really interesting topic. They also add that it helps that everything was linked together and the stakes were increasing through the story. 
     
  As all the feedback was positive in this section, I don't plan in changing anything relating to engagement. 
     
   #### - **Data visualization and their connection to the story**

   **This is the section where I got the most feedback and it was quite variated. I will go through the graphs in order:**
   
   ##### Second Graph
   - The **second graph** where you show the growth of streaming services is a bit confusing because I had to look at it a couple of times to understand that it was changing from 2011 to 2014, then 2011 to 2017, and finally from 2011 to 2020. 
    
   I will hopefully clear this problem when I export the graph from tableau and not have just screenshots. The idea behind the graph is that while the reader scrolls through the section, the bars will grow through the years. So it will be only one graph and not three. 
   
   ##### Fourth Graph  
   - I got a bit confused on the **fourth graph** (blue and orange lines) because your colors are not being consistent. In the second graph, you used blue for Disney + and Orange for Amazon, so when I got to this graph I was expecting this to still be true, however, it was not the case. Blue meant April 2020 and Orange December 2020.
   - It's not really clear what you want to show in the **fourth graph**. I thought it was showing a decrease in a trend. Maybe using a butterfly chart will help get the idea across in a better way.
   - I’m a bit confused on your **fourth graph**. I can’t really see a clear trend, and I don’t think the graph shows an average but you describe it as an average.
    
   I agree that this was a graph that didn't convey the information in a clear way to the viewer. I will look into the suggestion of using a butterfly char instead of this bar chart. 
    
   ##### Fifth Graph
   - For your **fifth graph** (forecast), you could maybe make the forecast area smaller to show a more focused trend.
   - On your **fifth graph**, is the light blue shaded part supposed to be a projection from that point forward? I know it might be weird to use two different platforms but flourish has a great way of doing that dotted line and it might be easier to understand.
    
   I'm going to look into using flourish for this graph. My original idea was using a dotted line, but I couldn't find a way to do it in tableau. That's why I stick to the light blue shaded area. 
      
  ##### Sixth Graph
