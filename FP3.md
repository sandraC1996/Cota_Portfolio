# Final Project: **Part 3**

## Changes from Part 2:
**For this final breakdown of my project, I'm going to focus on the major changes that happened between Part 2 and Part 3.**

After analyzing the feedback, I realized that no changes needed to happen to my outline, so it is staying the same that in Part 2. The biggest changes were in the graphs and the description of each section. First of all, I started by writing down the whole story and creating the connections between the main points I wanted to discuss.

Users with accounts in multiple streaming services are my _target audience_. So to let them know how powerful their input can be to a streaming company, I try to focus on the huge impact of streaming services and the great migration from Cable Tv to online streaming. Also, by highlighting how this is a trend that is likely to continue and the data the streaming services are recollecting today will be reflected in the content we get in the years to come.

To achieve this, I start by laying out the history of streaming services and the huge growth that has happened during the last years. Then I dive into the changes these streaming services have had in households and the reason behind this migration from Cable TV to streaming. To bring the story to a close, I focus the attention of the reader on how streaming services use the data they recollect from their users to create new content. My _call to action_ is directed to streaming services users. I want to make them aware that the content they are consuming and their interaction with the platform has a direct repercussion on the content that will be created in the future. 

#### The graphs
As stated at the end of Part 2, multiple changes could be done to improve the data visualization. 
- The one most noticeable was the "Increase in the number of streaming services subscriptions per household" graph. I relay in the suggestion of using a butterfly chart to show the shift of more households subscribing to a bigger amount of streaming services. 
- Another graph that had a major change was the original vs license content per platform. Initially, I had two bar charts that were divided between original and license content. However, it was hard to compare the content within the same service and how much it reflected from their total library. That's why I created two different visualizations. One that shows per service the amount of license and original content, and one that looks at it as a proportion of the whole library. 
- Lastly, I took a different approach for the growth of original content from Netflix to the years. In my original wireframe, I used a bubble chart. With each bubble representing a year and its size the amount of content. Because of the presentation, it was slightly difficult to show labels of the years in the bubbles, so I change it to a bar graph. I believe the difference between years is still quite noticeable and the information is depicted in a much clearer way.
- Other graphs also had small changes like color and size, but because they were minimum I'm not breaking them down as the previous ones.

## Summary
This was an incredibly useful project to do. Starting with understanding which is the right approach when you want to develop a story supported with data, and which are the steps you should take to ensure your audience is receiving the message as you intended. At the beginning of the class, I thought the main focus was going to be on generating data visualizations. I was pleasantly surprised when instead we learned about the work that goes behind creating the graphics. Gaining proper knowledge of when each graph should be used and how to criticize and analyze existing visualizations created a great foundation for when we started creating our own. The project was a great way to bring all the lessons learned through the semester together. I understand the value of having second opinions in your story and how outside feedback can elevate the final result. I also learned that it can take you way more time than originally expected. 

Creating the graphs is a really interesting process. By starting with wireframes on paper, you can get a good idea of how you want to represent your information, and find which visualization suits your information the best. However, once you get into the software is a whole different story. Some visualizations translate seamlessly from one medium to the other, but in some cases, this is not true. I found that they were two reasons for this situation. One is that once you start using the software you realize there is a better graph to show the content or two, you are not able to replicate what you had in mind by using the software. Although it can be disappointing at first, it leads to you rethinking your approach and finding other ways where the visualization is supporting the data that you wanted. 

I was happy to see the progress in how my project evolved at each stage and how receiving constructive feedback was the reason it ended where it did. It was also great to see how this was also the case with my peers. By having us share the content with each other, we could appreciate the evolution of their projects and see how far they were able to come.
