# Final Project: **Part 3**

## Changes from Part 2:
For this final breakdown of my project, I'm going to focus on the major changes that happened between Part 2 and Part 3. After analyzing the feedback, I realized that no changes needed to happen to my outline, so it is staying the same that in Part 2. The biggest changes were in the graphs and the description of each section.
First of all I started by writing down the whole story and creating the conections between the main points I wanted to discuss. With my selected target audience (users with accounts in multiple streaming services), I try to focus on the huge impact of streaming services and the great migration for Cable Tv to online streaming.

I start by laying out the history of streaming services and the huge growth that has happen during the last years. Then I dive into the changes this streaming services have had in households and the reason behind this migration from Cable TV to streaming. To bring the story to a close, I focus the attention of the reader on how streaming services use the data they recolect from their users to create new content. My call to action is address to the streaming services users. I want to make them aware that the content they are consuming and their interaction with the platfrom has direct repercution on the content that will be created in the future. 

#### The graphs
As stated at the end of Part 2, there were multiple changes that could be done to improve the data vizualization. 
- The one most notizable was the "Increase on the number of streaming services subscriptions per household" graph. I relay in the suggestion of using a buttefly chart to show the shift of more households subscribing to a bigger amount of streaming services. 
- Other graph that had a major change was the original vs license content per platform. Initialy I had two bar charts that were diveded between orignal and license content. However, it was hard to compare the content within the same service and how much it reflected from their total library. That's why I created two different visualizations. One that show per service the amount of licence and origianl content, and one that look at it as a proportion of the whole library. 
- Lastly, I took a different approach for the growth of original content from Netflix to the years. In my orignal wireframe, I used a bubble chart. With each bubble representing a year and its size the amount of content. Because of the presentation, it was slighly difficult to show labels of the years in the bubbles, so I change it to a bar graph. I believe the difference between years is still quite notizable and the information is depicted in a much clearer way.
- Other graphs also had small changes like color and size, but because they were minimum I'm not breaking them down as the previous ones.
