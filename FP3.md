# Final Project: **Part 3**

## Changes from Part 2:
For this final breakdown of my project, I'm going to focus on the major changes that happened between Part 2 and Part 3. After analyzing the feedback, I realized that no changes needed to happen to my outline, so it is staying the same that in part 2. The biggest changes were in the graphs and the description of each section.
First of all I started by writing down the whole story and creating the conections between the main points I wanted to discuss. With my selected target audience (users with accounts in multiple streaming services), I try to focus on the huge impact of streaming services and the great migration for Cable Tv to online streaming.

I start by laying out the history of streaming services and the huge growth that has happen during the last years. Then I dive into the changes this streaming services have had in households and the reason behind this migration from Cable TV to streaming. To bring the story to a close, I focus the attention of the reader on how streaming services use the data they recolect from their users to create new content. My call to action is address to the streaming services users. I want to make them aware that the content they are consuming and their interaction with the platfrom has direct repercution on the content that will be created in the future.
