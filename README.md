## About Me
Hi everyone! My name is **Sandra Cota** (she/her). I'm doing my master in Entertainment Industry Management at CMU. I have always been drawn into the entertainmet industry. I started by doing my bachelor in Animation and Digital Arts at Tecnologico de Monterrey, and then by coursing the 3D Animation and VFX program ar Vancouver Film School were I focus mainly in visual effects. I have work a couple of years as a _VFX artist_ and as a _Post-production project manager_ in a small company called Pixel Perfect in Mexico. After graduating from this program, I want to work as a Post-production coordinator and ultimately become a VFX producer.

## What I hope to learn
My goal is to be able to present data in a usefull way and by using good design principles. I'm really intrested in data visualization techniques. Knowing how to represent your information is crucial in any industry. It can also help you stand out in your presentations and be more efficient at any job you do.
