# Cota_Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling stories with Data at CMU!

## About Me
My name is **Sandra Cota** (she/her). I'm doing my master in Entertainment Industry Management at CMU. After graduating I want to work as a post-production coordinator and ultimately a VFX producer. However, I'm really intrested in data visualization techniques. 

## What I hope to learn
My goal is to be able to present data in a usefull way and by using good design principles. Knowing how to represent your information is crucial in any industry and can help you stand out in your presentations.
