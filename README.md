## About Me
Hi everyone! My name is **Sandra Cota** (she/her). I'm doing my master in Entertainment Industry Management at CMU. I have always been drawn into the entertainmet industry. I started by doing my bachelor in Animation and Digital Arts at Tecnologico de Monterrey, and then by coursing the 3D Animation and VFX program at Vancouver Film School were I focus mainly in visual effects. 

I have worked for a couple of years as a **_VFX artist_** and as a **_Post-production project manager_** in a small company called Pixel Perfect in Mexico. After graduating from this program, I want to work as a Post-production coordinator and ultimately become a VFX producer.

## What I hope to learn
I was quite excited to take this course. My main goal is to be able to present data in a usefull way and learning to use good design principles. I'm really intrested in data visualization techniques. Knowing how to represent your information is crucial in any industry. It can also help you stand out in your presentations and be more efficient at any job you do. I'm also intrested in exploring how the concepts I have learned as a VFX artist can be applied in datavis.
