This is my public portfolio for the Telling stories with Data at CMU!

## About Me
My name is **Sandra Cota** (she/her). I'm doing my master in Entertainment Industry Management at CMU. I did my bachelor in Animation and Digital Arts and I have a diploma from Vancouver Film School were I focus in 3D Animation and VFX. I have work a couple of years as a VFX artist and as a Post-production project manager. After graduating, I want to work as a Post-production coordinator and ultimately become a VFX producer.

## What I hope to learn
My goal is to be able to present data in a usefull way and by using good design principles. I'm really intrested in data visualization techniques. Knowing how to represent your information is crucial in any industry. It can also help you stand out in your presentations and be more efficient at any job you do.
